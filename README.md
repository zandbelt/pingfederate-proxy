Hans' PingFederate Proxy
========================

This proxy is a Java Servlet that allows bridging between connections in PingFederate.

Installation
------------

1. download PingFederate 7.x and deploy it together with a license file

2. install the Agentless Integration Kit 1.2
 
3. copy the proxy.war directory and the proxy.jar file in server/default/deploy (using cp -r)

4. configure one IDP and one SP Reference ID adapter with the settings below

5. enable target resource validation in the SP configuration application integration
   settings and lock down the TargetResource to the PingFederate proxy hostname

6. connect the defined Reference ID IDP and SP adapters to each of the SP and IDP
   connections respectively that you want to bridge to/from

7. review proxy.war/proxy.properties and edit as needed; typically only the hostname 
   since version 3.0 SSO sessions on the proxy are supported, cached for the duration
   of the `session.timeout setting`

The proxy IDP adapter can be instantiated multiple times, inheriting from a single parent,
to represent individual IDPs; the authentication service URL would then be extended with a
PartnerIdpId. IDP selection can then be done by connecting a specific proxy IDP adapter
instance to a connection, possibly using adapter selection for IDP groups, or in the
adapter2adapter case by passing in the IdpAdapterId after creating corresponding mappings.

For the Agentless Adapter 1.2 use the POST Transport Mode for best security.
