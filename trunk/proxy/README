Steps to produce a working setup:

 1) download PingFederate 7.x and deploy it together with a license file

 2) install the Agentless Integration Kit 1.2
 
 3) copy the proxy.war directory in server/default/deploy (using cp -r)

 4) configure one IDP and one SP Reference ID adapter with the settings below

 5) enable target resource validation in the SP configuration application integration
    settings and lock down the TargetResource to the PingFederate proxy hostname

 6) connect the defined Reference ID IDP and SP adapters to each of the SP and IDP
    connections respectively that you want to bridge to/from

 7) review proxy.war/proxy.properties and edit as needed; typically only the hostname
 
    version 3.0 supports SSO sessions that are cached on the proxy for the duration
    of the session.timeout setting

The proxy IDP adapter can be instantiated multiple times, inheriting from a single parent,
to represent individual IDPs; the authentication service URL would then be extended with a
PartnerIdpId. IDP selection can then be done by connecting a specific proxy IDP adapter
instance to a connection, possibly using adapter selection for IDP groups, or in the
adapter2adapter case by passing in the IdpAdapterId after creating corresponding mappings.

For the Agentless Adapter 1.2 use the POST Transport Mode for best security.
